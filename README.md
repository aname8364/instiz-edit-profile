# instiz edit profile
 If an attacker hijacks the session and the session expires, access permissions to the account will be lost.
 Although its possible to change the password on profile modify page, authentication of the existing password is required for access.
 Since the attacker only has the session, cant access to profile modify page.
 However, its possible to bypass password authentication and then change password, even without knowing the existing password.
